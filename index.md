# Getting Started with Model Variables

Speaking a common language and using the same variables is key for a united climate modelling community. While we are trying to bring together modellers from different communities, we understand that the variables used for climate modelling may differ for historical reasons.

Here, we are collating lists of different widely used variable formats:  
1) CMIP6 : Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) Version 6  
2) ERA5 : fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate
